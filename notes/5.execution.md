### 🌟 **Scene: A Classroom. Screens are on. Mics muted. Curiosity ON.**

You see students, just now I used four magical words —
- 👉 **CPU**,
- 👉 **RAM**,
- 👉 **Bit**,
- 👉 **CPU Cycle**

Now the big question is —
**“Are all these words the same or are they different?”**

**Students (confused):**
Sir, they are different… but also connected… maybe?

**Teacher:**
Fantastic! Yes, they are different — but beautifully connected like characters in a movie.

### 🎭 **Character 1: CPU — The Hero**

**Teacher:**
Sneha, what is CPU?

**Sneha:**
Sir, CPU means Central Processing Unit.

**Teacher (appreciating):**
Absolutely! But storytelling bhi thoda ho jaye?

Let me explain…

* CPU is like the **brain of the computer**.
* Whatever instruction comes — whether it’s adding numbers, opening Chrome, or playing music — the **CPU decides, calculates, and controls**.
* Inside the CPU, there are two powerful departments:

  * **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – does all calculations and logical decisions.
  * **CU (Control Unit)** – manages, controls, and coordinates everything like a manager.

So CPU is not just a chip —
**It is the “decision-maker” + “calculator” + “controller” of your entire computer.**

### 🎭 **Character 2: RAM — The CPU’s Workspace**

Now imagine CPU is a chef in a kitchen. He needs a table to chop veggies, mix ingredients, place spices…
That **table** is **RAM (Random Access Memory)**.

* CPU cannot work directly on data stored in hard disk — it’s too slow.
* So whatever program you run — MS Word, browser, game — first gets loaded into **RAM**.
* RAM is **temporary**, **fast**, and gets cleared when power goes off.

📌 **So, software → EXE file → loaded into RAM → converted into Process → executed by CPU.**


### 🎭 **Character 3: Bit — The Smallest Building Block**

Teacher writes on screen: **Bit (0 or 1)**

* Bit is like the smallest unit — just like **a drop of water forms an ocean**, **bits form everything in computers**.
* 1 Bit = Either 0 or 1
* 8 Bits = 1 Byte
* Everything — image, song, video, code — is stored in combinations of 0s and 1s.


### 🎭 **Character 4: CPU Cycle — The Heartbeat of CPU**

Now this is interesting…
CPU doesn’t perform tasks randomly. It works in a rhythm — a beat — like a heart.

That beat is called a **CPU Cycle** or **Clock Cycle**.

* One CPU cycle = **Fetch → Decode → Execute → Store**
* This is called **Instruction Cycle**.
* CPU speed is measured in **GHz (Giga Hertz)**.

  * 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second
  * So 3.5 GHz = 3.5 billion instructions per second (approximately!)

### 📌 **So, Are These All Same?**

| Term      | Meaning                         | Role in Computing                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| CPU       | The brain of the computer       | Executes instructions                     |
| RAM       | Short-term memory/workspace     | Stores program & data temporarily for CPU |
| Bit       | Smallest unit of data (0 or 1)  | Foundation of all data                    |
| CPU Cycle | One heartbeat of CPU operations | Fetch, decode, execute instructions       |

### 🎬 **Closing Scene**

So students, now tell me…
**Computer is not magic. It’s just a beautiful, disciplined coordination of CPU, RAM, bits, and cycles.**

**Teacher (smiles):**
Process is created… thread is assigned… and execution begins.

Are you all with me till this point?

## 🎬 **Scene 2: When a Program Comes to Life — Process & Thread**

Imagine you double-click **Chrome.exe** on your computer.

That exact moment… something magical happens inside.

### 💾 **1. EXE File – Just a Sleeping Body**

* `.exe` (executable file) is just a file stored on your hard disk.
* It contains your compiled instructions in **binary (0 and 1)**.
* But as long as it is on the hard disk, it is **dead — not running**.

### ⚡ **2. OS Brings It to Life → Creates a Process**

* The moment you click **Chrome.exe**, the OS says:

  > "Wake up, code… time to run!"
* OS copies the program from **Hard Disk → RAM**.
* At this stage, this loaded program becomes a **Process**.

✔ **Definition:**
👉 *Process = A program under execution (alive, with memory, identity, and resources).*

### 🧠 **3. Every Process Has:**

| Resource                 | Explanation                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PID (Process ID)**     | Unique ID (like Aadhar number for each process)        |
| **Memory Space**         | Exclusive space in RAM — no other process can touch it |
| **Program Counter (PC)** | Keeps track of which instruction to execute next       |
| **Stack, Heap**          | For function calls, variables, objects, etc.           |
| **Primary Thread**       | The execution unit that actually runs the code         |

### 🧵 **4. Thread – The Real Worker**

* If **Process is a company**,
  **Thread is the employee who actually works.**
* When OS creates a process, it always starts **with one thread** called the **Main or Primary Thread**.
* That thread starts executing code instruction by instruction.

✔ **Definition:**
👉 *Thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a process.*

⚡ **Example:**

* Open Chrome → **Chrome.exe → Process created with 1 thread**
* Chrome opens multiple tabs → internally, **more threads** are created!

### 🎯 **5. How CPU Executes a Process?**

CPU says:

> "I can handle only one instruction at a time per core — so give me threads."

* OS provides threads from processes to the CPU.
* CPU performs **Fetch → Decode → Execute → Store** cycles on each instruction.

This is repeated **millions or billions of times every second**.

### 📊 **Story Summary Table**

| Term      | Real-World Example  | Role in Computer                              |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| EXE File  | Recipe Book         | Just instructions, not running                |
| Process   | Chef starts cooking | Recipe is opened, kitchen (RAM) allocated     |
| Thread    | Chef’s hands        | Actually performing the steps                 |
| CPU Cycle | Heartbeat of Chef   | Chop → Cook → Stir (Fetch → Decode → Execute) |


### 🌟 **Dialogue Recap**

**Teacher:** So when you write software and double-click to run it… what happens first?

**Student (smiling):**
The EXE goes to RAM, becomes a Process… OS assigns a Primary Thread… CPU starts executing it cycle by cycle.

**Teacher (proud):**
Exactly! You just understood what 1st-year engineering students struggle with for months.


# 🎬 **Scene 3: Can One CPU Do So Many Tasks at Once?**

You are watching YouTube.
Your WhatsApp Web is open.
Spotify is playing songs.
And maybe… 10 Chrome tabs are open.

💡 **But wait — CPU has only one brain per core. So how are all these running together?**


## 🧠 **Magic Term: Multitasking** (But not Real, it's Fake!)

The CPU is super-fast. It works in **cycles measured in GHz**.

* c = 1,00,00,00,000 (1 billion) cycles per second.
* CPU works so fast that it runs **small slices of each program one by one**, and your eyes think it’s working on all of them *simultaneously*.
In each clock pulse (cycle), the CPU can perform one operation like fetch, decode, or execute — or part of it.

This technique is called **Time Sharing**.

### 😮 **Example:**

| Time (milliseconds) | What CPU does              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0–10 ms             | Execute YouTube process    |
| 10–20 ms            | Switch to Spotify thread   |
| 20–30 ms            | Switch to WhatsApp process |
| 30–40 ms            | Run your code editor       |

This switching is so fast that humans feel everything is running **together**.

## ⚙️ **But Who Manages This?**

👉 **The Operating System + CPU Scheduler**

It has a job:

* Many processes are waiting 📥
* CPU is the only worker 🧠
* OS decides **which process/thread to give CPU to, and for how long**

This decision-making is done by the **CPU Scheduler**.

### 🧾 **Popular CPU Scheduling Algorithms**

| Algorithm                         | Explanation                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** | Whoever comes first, gets CPU first            |
| **SJF (Shortest Job First)**      | Shortest process gets priority                 |
| **Round Robin (RR)**              | Each process gets fixed time slice (like 10ms) |
| **Priority Scheduling**           | High-priority process gets CPU first           |

In modern OS, **Round Robin + Priority Scheduling** is most common.

## 🔄 **Context Switching — The Real Hero**

Think like this…

* You (CPU) are reading a book (Process A).
* Suddenly, someone says, “Sir, reply to this WhatsApp message” (Process B).
* You bookmark the page, keep the book aside, open WhatsApp, reply, and come back to the book.

That bookmarking process is called **Context Switch**.

✔ **Context = current state of the process (registers, program counter, etc.)**

**OS saves this state → switches to another process → later restores it → resumes execution.**

### ⚡ **Context Switch Cost**

* It takes time.
* More switching = slow system.
* That’s why too many apps = laptop hangs 🖥️😩

## 👥 **Multi-Processing vs Multi-Threading**

| Feature       | Multi-Processing                | Multi-Threading                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Definition    | Multiple processes running      | Multiple threads inside one process   |
| Memory        | Each process has its own memory | Threads share same memory             |
| Example       | Chrome + Spotify + VS Code      | Chrome having multiple tabs (threads) |
| Speed         | Slower to create processes      | Faster to create threads              |
| Communication | Harder between processes        | Easier — shared memory                |


## 🛠️ **Simple Real-Life Analogy**

| Computer Term  | Real-Life Example                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| CPU            | Chef in the kitchen                          |
| Process        | A full recipe being prepared                 |
| Thread         | Chef's two hands doing different steps       |
| RAM            | Kitchen table where ingredients are kept     |
| Context Switch | Chef pausing one dish to work on another     |
| Scheduler (OS) | Restaurant manager deciding which dish first |


## ✅ **You Now Understand:**

- ✔ How a program becomes a process
- ✔ Role of thread in execution
- ✔ What is CPU cycle and process execution
- ✔ Why multitasking is not magic — it’s time-sharing
- ✔ What is context switching
- ✔ Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing


# Who Calls `main()`? 

## How Python and C Programs Start Execution?

🧑‍🏫 *“Friends, before learning any programming language — C, Java, Python — you must understand one simple truth: A program does not start by itself. Something must start it. Something must call the first function. But who?”*


## ✅ **Scene 1: The Birth of a Program – C vs Python**

💻 In **C language**, we always write:

```c
int main() {
    // code...
}
```

Students often ask:

- ❓ *“Sir, who calls `main()`? Do we call it manually?”*
- 👉 No. **You never call `main()` manually. The operating system does.**

Let’s break it down:

1. You compile your code → it becomes an **.exe (executable)**.
2. When you double-click the .exe **or run it using Terminal**, the OS:

   * Creates a **process**.
   * Inside the process, it creates a **Primary Thread** (also called Main Thread).
3. **That primary thread automatically calls `main()`**, and your program begins execution.

✔ So the answer is: **“Primary thread calls `main()`.”**



## ✅ **Scene 2: What About Python? There is No `main()` Function?**

Yes, Python doesn't force you to write a `main()` function. You just write code like:

```python
print("Hello")
```

But internally, this still happens:

1. You write `python app.py` in terminal.
2. The **Python interpreter is started by the OS**.
3. The OS creates a **process and a primary thread**.
4. This primary thread runs the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
5. The PVM reads your `.py` file **line by line (interpreted)**.
6. Execution begins from the first line — this is equivalent to `main()` in C.

So Python also has:
- ✔ A process
- ✔ A primary thread
- ✔ An entry point — **just without naming it `main()`**


## ✅ **Scene 3: Python vs C — Compilation vs Interpretation**

| Feature         | C Language                | Python                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Type            | Compiled                  | Interpreted                             |
| Entry Function  | `main()`                  | First line of program                   |
| Who calls it?   | Primary thread            | Primary thread                          |
| Output File     | `.exe` / `.out`           | No .exe — runs using Python Interpreter |
| Execution Style | Fast, direct machine code | Slower, line-by-line execution          |


## 🚗 **Scene 4: Bike Engine Analogy (Simple + Memorable)**

🛵 Think of your program like a **motorcycle engine**:

* When you **press the self-start button (run the program)** →
* The **battery provides power (OS creates a process)** →
* **Spark plug fires (primary thread is created)** →
* The **combustion begins (main() function is called)** →
* And your **engine starts running (program instructions execute).**

No spark plug? No primary thread? **No main() → No engine running.**


## ✨ **Final Magical Line to Tell Students:**

> “The first function of any program — whether it is `main()` in C or the first line in Python — is always called by the **primary thread inside the process**, and that thread is created by the **Operating System**.”

### ✅ **Let’s Continue the Story – CPU, Clock Cycle, ALU & Instruction Execution**

*(Mentor smiles… adjusts the marker and continues on the board)*

“Beta, jitne smooth tareeke se ek bike ka engine piston **up-down, up-down** karta hai every second… waise hi computer ke CPU ke andar **billions of choti-choti movements** hoti hain — but these are electrical, not mechanical.”

 
### 🕒 **Clock Cycle – The Heartbeat of CPU**

Just like:

| Real Life           | Meaning               | CPU Equivalent                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Tick-tick of clock  | 1 second pulse        | 1 CPU clock pulse                   |
| Heartbeat           | 1 pulse pumping blood | 1 clock pulse executing instruction |
| Engine piston cycle | 1 up-down motion      | 1 instruction phase                 |

**Hertz (Hz)** = *Number of clock cycles per second.*

* **1 Hz** = 1 cycle per second
* **1 kHz** = 1,000 cycles per second
* **1 MHz** = 1,000,000 cycles per second
* **1 GHz** = 1,000,000,000 cycles per second (1 billion ticks in just one second)

So, a CPU with **2.6 GHz speed** means:

- 👉 It ticks **2.6 billion times every second**
- 👉 Each tick = chance to perform part of an instruction


### ⚙️ **But what actually happens in 1 clock cycle?**

Just like in a bike:

1. **Suck fuel + air (Intake)**
2. **Compress**
3. **Ignite with spark**
4. **Exhaust**

Same way, CPU follows **Fetch → Decode → Execute → Store**

| CPU Phase       | Explanation                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fetch**       | Instruction is fetched from RAM into CPU             |
| **Decode**      | CPU understands "Is this add? subtract? jump?"       |
| **Execute**     | ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs the calculation |
| **Write/Store** | Result is stored in register or memory               |

 

### 🧠 **Registers – Small but Super Fast Brains**

RAM is like a water tank.
Registers are like a glass of water in your hand – instantly available.

Types:

* **PC (Program Counter)** – tells which instruction to run next
* **ACC (Accumulator)** – stores results from ALU
* **General Registers (R1, R2, …)** – hold temporary values
* **SP (Stack Pointer)** – points to top of function (stack memory)

  

### ⚡ **ALU – Arithmetic Logic Unit = Dil + Dimaag of CPU**

It handles:
- ✅ Addition (ADD)
- ✅ Subtraction
- ✅ Compare (CMP)
- ✅ AND, OR, XOR (Logic)
- ✅ JUMP (if condition met)

Example:

```
MOV R1, 5     ; Load 5 into Register 1
MOV R2, 3     ; Load 3 into Register 2
ADD R1, R2    ; R1 = R1 + R2 (5 + 3 = 8)
CMP R1, 10    ; Compare R1 with 10
JUMP_IF_LT X  ; Jump to label X if less than
```

Each of these instructions might take **1, 2, or more clock cycles**.


### 🚀 **Why So Fast That We Don’t Notice?**

Let’s compare speeds:

| Action               | Time Taken                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Blink your eye       | ~300 milliseconds                            |
| Heartbeat            | ~800 milliseconds                            |
| 1 CPU clock at 3 GHz | **0.00000000033 seconds (0.33 nanoseconds)** |

Means while you blink your eye once, **CPU executes nearly 900 million cycles!**

 

### 🎯 **So who calls `main()` in C and Python?**

| Language           | Who Calls Main Function?                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C / C++ / Java** | OS creates a **primary thread**, loads your program → sets registers → calls `main()`                             |
| **Python**         | No fixed `main()`. Python interpreter runs file line by line. But internally, it still creates a **main thread**. |

So in both cases:

- ✅ OS → loads program into memory
- ✅ Creates **Primary Thread (main thread)**
- ✅ Sets Program Counter → points to first instruction (`main()` start)
- ✅ CPU starts clocking → instructions begin running


✅ **Where We Are in the Story So Far:**

- ✔ You learned **how the CPU works internally** with clock cycles, ALU, registers, instructions…
- ✔ You now understand **who calls `main()` in C and Python** and how programs begin.
- ✔ Perfect bridge to the next concept: **"How does the program (EXE / .out / Python script) get loaded from disk into RAM and start running?"**


### 🚪 **Scene: How OS Loads an EXE into RAM & Starts the Program**

*(Mentor walks slowly to the whiteboard, draws a small hard disk, a RAM chip, and a CPU box…)*

“Beta, imagine you have a book inside your bag (hard disk). You want to read it. Can you read it while it's still inside your bag? No! You **take it out, put it on the desk**, open it, and start reading.

Computer also does the same. Your program (EXE file) is stored in the **hard disk (bag)**. But **CPU cannot read from disk directly**; it first needs to **load it into RAM (study desk).**”

### 🛠 **Step-by-Step Story of Loading a Program (C, C++, Python — same idea)**

| Step                                                                 | What Happens Inside the Computer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. You double click program / type `./a.out` or `python file.py`** | You "request" the OS to run a program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **2. OS creates a new Process**                                      | It assigns a **Process ID (PID)** and prepares a separate world for your program.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **3. Memory is allocated – divided into sections:**                  | OS reserves space in **RAM** → creates 4 main segments: <br>✅ **Text/Code Section** → machine instructions <br>✅ **Data Section** → global and static variables <br>✅ **Heap** → dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`, `new`) <br>✅ **Stack** → function calls, local variables |
| **4. Loader loads executable into RAM**                              | The **Loader** is like a librarian. It copies machine instructions from disk into the **Code Section in RAM**.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **5. CPU Registers are prepared**                                    | OS sets: <br>📌 **PC (Program Counter)** = start of `main()` <br>📌 **SP (Stack Pointer)** = top of stack memory <br>📌 Clears registers & flags                                                                                                                                  |
| **6. OS creates Primary Thread**                                     | Just like we learned → one **main thread** begins execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **7. CPU starts executing from `main()`**                            | Now instructions enter **Fetch → Decode → Execute** cycle using clock pulses.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### 🧠 **Analogy in Real Life**

| Computer Term        | Real Life Example                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| EXE in Disk          | Book in school bag                     |
| RAM                  | Table where you study                  |
| Loader               | You taking the book out of the bag     |
| CPU                  | You reading and understanding the book |
| Program Counter (PC) | Your finger pointing to current line   |
| Stack                | Notes you're writing for each question |
| Heap                 | Extra pages you request from friend    |


### ✅ **So, Shall We Continue?**

You asked the right question — *“What comes next?”*
We now have two clear paths:

* ✅ **We’ve explained how EXE is loaded into RAM and how CPU starts executing `main()`**
* 👉 Now it’s time to zoom inside the memory of a running program.
